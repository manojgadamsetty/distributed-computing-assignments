Notes:
- Assignment 1: Lamport mutual exclusion implemented using XML-RPC (node.py).
  Use 'req' in node CLI to request CS.

- Assignment 2: Simplified OM-based Byzantine agreement using XML-RPC (lieutenant.py / commander.py).
  Mark a lieutenant as byzantine in config.json to simulate faulty behavior.
