# Distributed Computing Assignments (M.Tech)

This repository contains implementations of distributed algorithms for the Distributed Computing course (M.Tech).  
Each assignment uses **RPC (XML-RPC)** for inter-node communication and includes runnable simulation code.

## Assignments
- Assignment 1 — Lamport's Distributed Mutual Exclusion using RPC  
  Folder: `Assignment-1-Lamport-Mutex/`

- Assignment 2 — Byzantine Agreement Protocol using RPC  
  Folder: `Assignment-2-Byzantine-Agreement/`

## Quick start
1. Clone the repo.
2. Edit `config.json` in each assignment folder if you need different ports.
3. Use the provided `run_*.sh` scripts to start processes (or start manually).
